<p>Your task is to adapt the heat equation code that we have previously developed to solve the system in 2 dimensions. You will need to demonstrate the following MPI feature</p>

<ul><li>Derived datatypes (most likely Vector) to handle processes boundaries</li>
	<li>A Cartesian topology which is used to distribute the data</li>
</ul><p>Preferably run your code using up to 32 processes (e.g., 2,4,8,16,32)</p></div>
